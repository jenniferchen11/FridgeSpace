# IngredientApp

Created for TOHacks 2021!

### Inspiration 🧠

With the average single-family household **throwing away over 200kg of food every year**, FridgeSpace bridges the main causes of food waste by **addressing consumers' lack of planning**, attitudes towards preferences, and behaviour. 

### What it does 💻

The core features include a **virtual fridge** that tracks the expiration of food to prevent waste, an ingredients scanner that __identifies foods__ and their alignments with dietary restrictions, and many customizable features to suit your food needs! 

Some features include:
- Customizable food combinations/preferences 🍔
- Family/Family member fridge specifications 🥑
- Past order information 🧾
- Favourites ❤️
- Average expiry times ⛔
- Where to buy 🛒
- Sustainability measurements 🌳

# The Logistics

### How we built it 🧱

We used **Figma** to visualize our design as well as prototype features before developing the app through **React Native using Javascript and CSS**. We also used several APIs including **Courier** and **Google Cloud Vision OCR** to allow users to receive notifications about food in their fridges.

Here is an image of our mockup:

# Our Takeaways

### Challenges we ran into 😠

It was challenging using courier as it was a new platform that we have never used before and required understanding a new language. Some of the courier challenges involved variables not being shown in delivered text messages and images not appearing. It was also a bit of a challenge having a diverse group because within the group there were different time zones meaning we had to manage our time effectively.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of 😊

With a **diverse team** with various skills and age ranges, we learnt through understanding each other's abilities and experimenting in others' specialties. From data analytics to coding on a new framework, **we supported each other** throughout the process of learning. We are especially proud of successfully using the Courier API to send SMS messages, and using AI/ML through Google Cloud Vision's OCR.

### What we learned 📖

We learned how to work together in a group with a limited time frame to produce a really cool project. We also learned some new languages and were are able to develop our __CS skills__!

## What's next for FridgeSpace 🤷‍♀️
We'd love to take any feedback and hear from you! We hope to expand FridgeSpace with greater complexity, and potentially integrate **Firebase** as a backend database to store user preferences.
